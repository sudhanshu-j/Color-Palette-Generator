# Color Palette Generator

A simple Color Palette Generator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project dynamically generates a set of random colors, displays them in a grid layout, and allows users to copy any color's hex code by clicking on it. The palette can be refreshed at any time to display a new set of colors.

## Code Analysis

### HTML

The HTML file provides the core structure for the app:

- `<ul class="container">` acts as a container for color boxes that are dynamically generated by JavaScript.

- A "Refresh" button is available for regenerating the color palette with a new set of random colors.

### CSS

The CSS file applies styling to give the app its visual layout and effects:

- **Font**: Google Font (Mukta) is imported for consistent typography.

- **Flexbox Layout**: `.container` uses Flexbox for responsive grid layout of color boxes.

- **Color Boxes**: Styled with padding, shadow, and rounded corners.

- **Hover and Active States**: Hover effects to slightly brighten colors, and active state on color boxes for click feedback.

- **Media Query**: Adjusts layout for screens smaller than 500px, making the app mobile-friendly.

### JavaScript

The JavaScript file provides the app's interactive functionality:

- **Random Color Generation**: Generates random hex color codes using `Math.random()` and applies these as background colors to color boxes.

- **Copy to Clipboard**: Clicking a color box copies the hex color code to the clipboard and briefly shows "Copied" feedback.

- **Palette Refresh**: Clicking the "Refresh" button calls the `generatePalette` function to replace the current colors with a new set.
